   ** Warning ** Foundation:Kiva="SLAB DETAILS", no Interior Horizontal Insulation Material Name defined
   **   ~~~   ** Interior Horizontal Insulation Depth will not be used.
   ** Warning ** Foundation:Kiva="SLAB DETAILS", no Exterior Horizontal Insulation Material Name defined
   **   ~~~   ** Exterior Horizontal Insulation Width will not be used.
   ** Warning ** Foundation:Kiva="SLAB DETAILS", no Footing Material Name defined
   **   ~~~   ** Footing Depth will not be used.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 27 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Severe  ** WaterHeater:Mixed = ELECTRICWATERHEATER_50GAL:  Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name not found = DHWSETPOINTSCHEDULE
   ** Warning ** GeneratorController constructor ElectricLoadCenter:Generators, Availability Schedule for Generator:PVWatts '3 KW PV' will be be ignored (runs all the time).
   ** Warning ** For object = Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed, name = "ZONE1PTHPDXCOOLCOIL"
   **   ~~~   ** Calculated outlet air relative humidity greater than 1. The combination of
   **   ~~~   ** rated air volume flow rate, total cooling capacity and sensible heat ratio yields coil exiting
   **   ~~~   ** air conditions above the saturation curve. Possible fixes are to reduce the rated total cooling
   **   ~~~   ** capacity, increase the rated air volume flow rate, or reduce the rated sensible heat ratio for this coil.
   **   ~~~   ** If autosizing, it is recommended that all three of these values be autosized.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Inputs used for calculating cooling coil bypass factor.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Inlet Air Temperature     = 26.67 C
   **   ~~~   ** ...Outlet Air Temperature    = 12.69 C

   ************* Testing Individual Branch Integrity
   ************* All Branches passed integrity testing
   ************* Testing Individual Supply Air Path Integrity
   ************* All Supply Air Paths passed integrity testing
   ************* Testing Individual Return Air Path Integrity
   ************* All Return Air Paths passed integrity testing
   ************* No node connection errors were found.
   ** Warning ** For ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator "ERV1" there is unbalanced exhaust air flow.
   **   ~~~   ** ... The exhaust air mass flow rate = 5.526658E-002
   **   ~~~   ** ... The  supply air mass flow rate = 4.158695E-002

   **   ~~~   ** ... Unless there is balancing infiltration / ventilation air flow, this will result in
   **   ~~~   ** ... load due to induced outside air being neglected in the simulation.
