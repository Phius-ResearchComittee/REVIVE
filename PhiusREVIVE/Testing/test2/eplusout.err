   ** Warning ** Foundation:Kiva="SLAB DETAILS", no Interior Horizontal Insulation Material Name defined
   **   ~~~   ** Interior Horizontal Insulation Depth will not be used.
   ** Warning ** Foundation:Kiva="SLAB DETAILS", no Exterior Horizontal Insulation Material Name defined
   **   ~~~   ** Exterior Horizontal Insulation Width will not be used.
   ** Warning ** Foundation:Kiva="SLAB DETAILS", no Footing Material Name defined
   **   ~~~   ** Footing Depth will not be used.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 25 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** GeneratorController constructor ElectricLoadCenter:Generators, Availability Schedule for Generator:PVWatts '3 KW PV' will be be ignored (runs all the time).
   ** Warning ** AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem = GASHEATDXACFURNACE
   **   ~~~   ** Method used to determine the cooling supply air flow rate is not specified when cooling coil is present.
   ** Warning ** AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem = GASHEATDXACFURNACE
   **   ~~~   ** Method used to determine the heating supply air flow rate is not specified when heating coil is present.
   ** Warning ** For object = Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed, name = "FURNACE ACDXCOIL 1"
   **   ~~~   ** Calculated outlet air relative humidity greater than 1. The combination of
   **   ~~~   ** rated air volume flow rate, total cooling capacity and sensible heat ratio yields coil exiting
   **   ~~~   ** air conditions above the saturation curve. Possible fixes are to reduce the rated total cooling
   **   ~~~   ** capacity, increase the rated air volume flow rate, or reduce the rated sensible heat ratio for this coil.
   **   ~~~   ** If autosizing, it is recommended that all three of these values be autosized.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Inputs used for calculating cooling coil bypass factor.
