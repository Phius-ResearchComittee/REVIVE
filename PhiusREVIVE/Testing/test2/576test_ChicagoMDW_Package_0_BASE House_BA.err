   ** Warning ** Foundation:Kiva="SLAB DETAILS", no Interior Horizontal Insulation Material Name defined
   **   ~~~   ** Interior Horizontal Insulation Depth will not be used.
   ** Warning ** Foundation:Kiva="SLAB DETAILS", no Exterior Horizontal Insulation Material Name defined
   **   ~~~   ** Exterior Horizontal Insulation Width will not be used.
   ** Warning ** Foundation:Kiva="SLAB DETAILS", no Footing Material Name defined
   **   ~~~   ** Footing Depth will not be used.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 25 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** GeneratorController constructor ElectricLoadCenter:Generators, Availability Schedule for Generator:PVWatts '3 KW PV' will be be ignored (runs all the time).
   ** Warning ** AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem = GASHEATDXACFURNACE
   **   ~~~   ** Method used to determine the cooling supply air flow rate is not specified when cooling coil is present.
   ** Warning ** AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem = GASHEATDXACFURNACE
   **   ~~~   ** Method used to determine the heating supply air flow rate is not specified when heating coil is present.
   ************* Testing Individual Branch Integrity
   ************* All Branches passed integrity testing
   ************* Testing Individual Supply Air Path Integrity
   ************* All Supply Air Paths passed integrity testing
   ************* Testing Individual Return Air Path Integrity
   ************* All Return Air Paths passed integrity testing
   ************* No node connection errors were found.
   ** Warning ** For ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator "ERV1" there is unbalanced exhaust air flow.
   **   ~~~   ** ... The exhaust air mass flow rate = 3.335688E-002
   **   ~~~   ** ... The  supply air mass flow rate = 2.510036E-002
   **   ~~~   **  Environment=CHICAGO MIDWAY AP ANN HTG 99.6% CONDNS DB HVAC Sizing Pass 1, at Simulation time=01/21 00:00 - 00:15
   **   ~~~   ** ... Unless there is balancing infiltration / ventilation air flow, this will result in
   **   ~~~   ** ... load due to induced outside air being neglected in the simulation.
   ************* Beginning Simulation
   ************* Simulation Error Summary *************
   ************* There are 1 unused objects in input.
   ************* Use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayUnusedObjects; to see them.
   *************
   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
