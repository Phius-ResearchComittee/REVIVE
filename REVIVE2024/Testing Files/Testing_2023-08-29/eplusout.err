   ** Warning ** SurfaceProperty:ExposedFoundationPerimeter: SLAB, TOTALEXPOSEDPERIMETER set as calculation method, but a value has been set for Exposed Perimeter Fraction. This value will be ignored.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings;
