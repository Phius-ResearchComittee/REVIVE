    "Demand Cooling Available":"Check this box if demand limited cooling is available for the project. The model will maintain a setback temperature of 80.6°F. When cooling is called for, but no onsite PV is provided, the model will draw from the battery, and this unmet demand is calculated in the battery sizing outputs. When extra PV production is available, the control sequence will overcool the building below the setback temperature.",
    "Natural Ventilation Available":"Check this box if natural ventilation is used in the building during an outage. If checked, the input for Natural Ventilation Type is required.",
    "Natural Ventilation Type":"If the input Natural Ventilation Available is checked, select either NatVent or SchNatVent as natural ventilation type for use during the summer outage.\n\nNatVent: This control sequence uses a delta dry bulb temperature control. Whenever the outdoor air temperature is 1.8°F cooler than the indoor air, the windows will be opened.\n\nSchNatVent: This control sequence uses a delta dry bulb temperature control and an astronomical clock to determine if the sun is up. Whenever the outdoor air temperature is 1.8°F cooler than the indoor air and the sun is not up, the windows will be opened.",
    "Databases":"To begin using the REVIVEcalc tool, a database folder must be designated, which contains .csv files that are user editable. The baseline database folder can be downloaded from the Github repository where the software tool is downloaded from. All databases should be kept in a folder following the same format as the one downloaded. It is recommended to leave the databases folder as is when downloaded and modify the individual databases as needed within that folder. More information can be found for each of the required databases on their own help pages."
