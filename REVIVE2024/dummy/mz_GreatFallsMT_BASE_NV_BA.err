   ** Warning ** Foundation:Kiva="SLAB DETAILS", no Footing Material Name defined
   **   ~~~   ** Footing Depth will not be used.
   ** Warning ** SurfaceProperty:ExposedFoundationPerimeter: SLAB, TOTALEXPOSEDPERIMETER set as calculation method, but a value has been set for Exposed Perimeter Fraction. This value will be ignored.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 67 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** GeneratorController constructor ElectricLoadCenter:Generators, Availability Schedule for Generator:PVWatts 'PV ARRAY' will be be ignored (runs all the time).
   ** Warning ** SetUpDesignDay: Entered DesignDay Barometric Pressure=88606 differs by more than 10% from Standard Barometric Pressure=98934.
   **   ~~~   ** ...occurs in DesignDay=GREAT FALLS INTL ARPT ANN HTG 99% CONDNS DB, Standard Pressure (based on elevation) will be used.
   ** Warning ** SetUpDesignDay: Entered DesignDay Barometric Pressure=88606 differs by more than 10% from Standard Barometric Pressure=98934.

   ** Warning ** SetUpDesignDay: Entered DesignDay Barometric Pressure=88606 differs by more than 10% from Standard Barometric Pressure=98934.
   **   ~~~   ** ...occurs in DesignDay=GREAT FALLS INTL ARPT ANN CLG 1% CONDNS DB=>MWB, Standard Pressure (based on elevation) will be used.
   ** Warning ** AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem = WHOLEHOUSE_GASHEAT_DXAC_FURNACE
   **   ~~~   ** Method used to determine the cooling supply air flow rate is not specified when cooling coil is present.
   ** Warning ** AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem = WHOLEHOUSE_GASHEAT_DXAC_FURNACE
   **   ~~~   ** Method used to determine the heating supply air flow rate is not specified when heating coil is present.
   ************* Testing Individual Branch Integrity
   ************* All Branches passed integrity testing
   ************* Testing Individual Supply Air Path Integrity
   ************* All Supply Air Paths passed integrity testing
   ************* Testing Individual Return Air Path Integrity
   ************* All Return Air Paths passed integrity testing
   ************* No node connection errors were found.
   ** Warning ** For ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator "WHOLEHOUSE ERV" there is unbalanced exhaust air flow.
   **   ~~~   ** ... The exhaust air mass flow rate = 3.329735E-002
   **   ~~~   ** ... The  supply air mass flow rate = 2.381690E-002
   **   ~~~   **  Environment=GREAT FALLS INTL ARPT ANN HTG 99.6% CONDNS DB HVAC Sizing Pass 1, at Simulation time=01/21 00:00 - 00:15
   **   ~~~   ** ... Unless there is balancing infiltration / ventilation air flow, this will result in
   **   ~~~   ** ... load due to induced outside air being neglected in the simulation.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
